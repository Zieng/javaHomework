- top panel is draw setting panel, you can set such as fonts,color.
- bottom panel is message panel, when you do a operation, you will see the message.

##Usage
Just take a look at the sofware, I'm sure you will get to know how to use it in seconds.
Now it supports only draw:
- line
- rectangle
- ellipse(include circle of course)
- text

May be in the future I will add more figure to the software.
##Others
1. You should click the border of the rectangle or the ellipse if you want to select them, and for others, you can just click the rectangle area contains them. The algorithm for how to decide a figure is selected is far from being mature in this program.
2. The support file to open is only text file and it can only get figure from fixed format, you don't open other file with other format or don't change the file you create from this software.
